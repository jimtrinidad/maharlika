By way of illustration only, Confidential Information may include this Agreement, trade secrets, know-how, inventions, contractual disclosures, techniques, processes, algorithms, software programs, schematics, software source documents, contracts, customer lists, financial information, sales and marketing plans, information and business plans and other proprietary information, whether or not such information is marked as confidential. Confidential Information shall not include, even if it is marked as such, information that: (i) is already known to the receiving Party at the time of disclosure, which knowledge the receiving Party shall have the burden of proving; (ii) is, or, through no act or failure to act of the receiving Party, becomes publicly known; (iii) is readily observable and / or duplicable by the public; (iv) is legally received by receiving Party from a third party without restriction on disclosure; (v) is independently developed by receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information of the disclosing Party; or (vi) is approved for release by written authorization of the disclosing Party. In maintaining the confidentiality of the other Party&rsquo;s Confidential Information, each Party shall use at least the same standard that Party uses for its own confidential information of similar type, and shall take necessary precautions not to disclose such information to any person except its officers, employees or subcontractors, who have a need to know in order to comply with the obligations of this Agreement. Each Party&rsquo;s officers, employees, and subcontractors shall be bound by the terms of this Section or a similar written agreement with terms no less protective of either Party&rsquo;s Confidential Information than this Agreement. The Parties agree that a Party is entitled to injunctive relief as a remedy for any breach of this Section. Nothing in this Section shall prohibit Aexponents Systems Inc. from disseminating aggregated information that contains no identifiable Subscriber Confidential Information.</p>

				<p align="justify"><strong>Arbitration. </strong>Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the provision of the Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the most current commercial arbitration rules of the Philippine Arbitration Board. Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. The arbitration shall be conducted in the City of Pasig and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof in the City of Pasig, Republic of the Philippines. However, subject to the foregoing arbitration provision, Subscriber and Aexponents Systems Inc. agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the city of Pasig. Either Subscriber or Aexponents Systems Inc. may seek an interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in Pasig City, necessary to protect the rights or property of Subscriber or Aexponents Systems Inc. (or its agents, suppliers, and subcontractors) pending the completion of arbitration. SUBSCRIBER AND AEXPONENTS SYSTEMS INC. AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both Parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual Party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that Party&rsquo;s individual claim.</p>
